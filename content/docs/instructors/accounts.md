# Instructor Accounts

To prevent anyone from being able to remove entries from the queue, these
privileges are only avaialble to users logged in with an instructor account.

## Logging-in

You can log in to your instructor account by clicking the `Instructor Login` in the
top right navigation menu. If you successfully logged in, the `Instructor Login`
should have changed to an `Instructors` drop down menu.

## Reset Your Password

If you forgot your password, or you never set a password, you can click
`Reset Password` on the Login page. Enter the email address associated
with your account.
An email with reset instructions will be sent to your address.
(Check your spam if you don't see it).

## New Instructor Accounts

New instructor accounts can be created by "Admin" accounts. If logged in as
an admin, you can modify instructor accounts in the `Admin` page in the top
right dropdown menu. To create a new instructor account simply click
`Create Instructor` under the list of current accounts. Fill out the
details. You can also choose whether this instructor should have an admin account.
Once the account is created, an email will be automatically sent to the
address specified for the instructor to set the password for their account.

{{< hint warning >}}
Instructor accounts **cannot** be deleted, they can only be de-activated (prevents
logging in with this account).

## Editing Instructor Accounts

Admins can also edit instructor accounts. Click on the `Admin` page in the dropdown
menu in the top right. Next to an instructor's entry, click `Edit`. You can change
the instructor's name and email. (Password changes have to be done through
Reset Password). If changing the email, this will change the email used for logging
into this account.
