# Managing the Queue

You can view and manage the queue in the same tab students will go to see it.
Simply click the `View` tab in the top navigation bar. The page will
look something like this:

{{< figure src="../queue-page.png" >}}

## Opening/Closing the Queue

At the top of the `View` page, there is a button to Open or Close the queue.
(The `Open` button is shown when the queue is currently closed and vice versa)

If the queue is closed, students will no longer be able to join the queue
on the `Join` page. Students already in the queue will stay there until helped
or removed.

## The Queue Itself

The queue is laid out about how you'd expect: the students who have been in the
queue the longest are at the top of the page. If you click on the chevron to the
left of their name, it will expand/collapse the entry. The expanded entry
shows the problem description the student included and how long they've been
in the queue (in Central Time).

## Helping/Removing Students

On the right side of each queue entry there are two buttons: "Start Helping"
and "Remove." The "Start Helping" button should be clicked when you're about
to start helping the student. The "Remove" button can be used if the student
did not show up or will not be helped for some other reason.

On the surface, these two buttons appear to do the same thing:
they will remove the student from the queue. The only difference between
these two buttons is for bookkeeping purposes in our database. Later on, if we
want to see the average amount of time a student had to wait, it can be helpful
to filter out the no-shows.
