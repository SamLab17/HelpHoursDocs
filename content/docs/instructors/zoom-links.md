# Changing Zoom Links

You have the option to add the links to your Help Hours Zoom meetings to this
website. The links will be visible to students when they visit the `Zoom Links`
tab on the website.

To change the Zoom links displayed, visit the `Zoom Links` tab while logged in.
There should be a button labeled `Change Zoom Links.`

## Add Zoom Links

Use this form on the left to add Zoom Links:

{{< figure src="../add-zoom.png" >}}

You can add a description for the link (we typically use the hours
the link is active). Then you can paste the Zoom link itself.
These are of the form `https://utexas.zoom.us/j/...`.
Finally there is a `Day` dropdown menu. This allows you to group your links
by day of the week. If you don't want this grouping, you can use the `Other`
option.

If you re-use the same zoom link multiple times in throughout the week, you can have 
duplicate zoom links with appropriate descriptions.

There is an important caveat with this form: **Zoom links should be entered in
chronological order for each day.** The order in which the links determines the
order they are displayed on the `Zoom Links` page. If these are out of order,
it can be annoying for students to find the right link.

## Remove Zoom Links

You can remove Zoom links using the other form:

{{< figure src="../remove-zoom.png" >}}

Simply select the link you want to remove and click `Remove Link`.
