# Account Setup

This page is meant for instructors who have just had an account created for them
for their class's Help Hours website. 

## Setting Your Password

You should have received an email asking you to set your password for your
instructor account. If you don't see this email check your spam folder.

If when you click on this link it says the link is no longer valid, click
on the `Instructor Login` button in the top right, click `Reset Password`,
and enter the email address you received the first email. This will give you
a new link to set your password.

Once you've set your password, try logging in. If logged in, the top right
`Instructor Login` button will have changed to an `Instructors` dropdown menu.

If you have any issues, feel free to [Contact us.](../../contact)
