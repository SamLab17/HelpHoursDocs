# Joining the Queue

Joining the queue is simple!

Click on the `Join` tab in the top navigation bar.
That should bring up this form:

{{< figure src="../join.png" >}}

Enter your name (first name and last initial should suffice), email, EID, and a short description of what you need help on.

After you sign up, you should receive a
confirmation email to the address you entered.

If the `Join the Queue!` button seems disabled, the queue may be closed. Make sure an instructor
is currently holding help hours. If you think the queue being closed is a mistake,
let your instructors know (e.g. make a Piaza post!).
