# Removing Yourself from the Queue

To remove yourself from the queue, click on the
`Remove Self` tab in the top navigation bar.

There, you'll need to enter the EID you used
when you joined the queue.

If you don't remember what you entered, the confirmation email sent to you when you joined will include the EID you used at the bottom.
